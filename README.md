# Overview
To generate a coherent and understandable text. We extracted commonsense knowledge from ConceptNet automatically and
combined a constructed word semantic embedding model and a designed Deep Neural Network of
discourse coherence model with Monte-Carlo Tree Search to find suboptimal branches in a large search space and the limited time.  
We evaluated generated paragraphs by human rating, our model can generate more coherent paragraphs when using the discourse coherence model and refined ConceptNet.
