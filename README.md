# Overview
To generate coherent and understandable text.
We extracted commonsense knowledge from ConceptNet automatically and combined a constructed word semantic embedding model and a designed Deep Neural Network of
discourse coherence model with Monte-Carlo Tree Search to find suboptimal branches in a large search space and the limited time.  
We evaluated generated text by human rating, and it is more coherent when using the discourse coherence model and refined ConceptNet.
