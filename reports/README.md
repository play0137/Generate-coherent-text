User inputs an initial concept (subject), we first check whether it exists in ConceptNet or not.  
If it doesn't exist in ConceptNet, we substitute initial concept for its plesionyms or user can reinput it.  
And we adopt MCTS to simulate different combinations of concepts and evaluate coherence of generated texts by the coherence model.  
We paraphrase the texts generated by MCTS with plesionyms and pronouns, and evaluate these texts by the coherence model.  
Lastly, select one of the best results as our final output text.
