## System flowchart

</p>

The user inputs an initial concept (subject) as the main topic which could be a living organism that can conduct the actions or concepts which can be described, such as person, animal or occupation, etc.  
We first check whether the initial concept exists in ConceptNet or not.  
If it doesn't exist in ConceptNet, we substitute it for its plesionyms or user can reinput it.  
Then we adopt MCTS to simulate different combinations of concepts and evaluate coherence of generated texts by the coherence model.  
We paraphrase the texts generated by MCTS with plesionyms and pronouns, and evaluate these texts by the coherence model.  
Lastly, select one of the best results as our final output text.

## Positive and negative samples of coherence model

</p>

The paragraphs on the left side are the positive samples and the right side are the negative ones.  
The scores of positive samples are all higher than negative ones.  
Four or five words in the first two examples are substituted by other connected words which has the same POS in ConceptNet, and the coherence model can distinguish them easily.
The rest of the examples only substitute two words, the model can still predict correctly.  
It proves that the coherence model can actually distinguish the coherent and incoherent texts to some degree.
